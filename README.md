## Instructions
Edit index.js and do the following
1. Use `filter` to remove all fruits that are bananas and store those in the array `filteredFruits`
2. Use `map` to make a new array where all fruits are in uppercase letters called `uppercaseFruits`
3. Use `reduce` to count the number of bananas in the array and store in a variable `bananaCount`
4. Use `find` to find the first fruit with only 4 characters in the name and store in variable `fourFruit`
5. Use `findIndex` to find the fruit index who is exactly 10 characters in length and store in a variable `tenFruit`
6. Use `sort` to change the original array into being sorted
